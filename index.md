## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to design a robot that can navigate, interact with the environment, and score the maximum points within the time limit. Tasks will include:

- Obstacle avoidance
- Target acquisition
- Item collection or manipulation
- Real-time communication with other servers

---

## 👥 Who Can Participate?

- 💡 Open to all tech-minded students
- 🤖  members per team
- 🛠️ Any programming language and hardware allowed (within constraints)

---

## 🧪 Technical Requirements

Your robot must:
- Be self-contained or controlled via a remote interface
- Use onboard sensors or a vision system for autonomy
- Communicate with a game server over a network (optional)
- Be safe, stable, and respect arena constraints

> The project involves software (C/C++, Python, ROS, etc.) and hardware (motors, sensors, microcontrollers, etc.)
